# MalariaSpendingUtility


This project analyzes how malaria spending priorities relate to disease outcomes across **Sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean** from 2000–2020.  
We use publicly available data from **IHME Global Malaria Spending**, **WHO/Our World in Data incidence estimates**, and **IHME Global Burden of Disease (GBD) deaths**.

What we looked at:
- Grouped interventions into three bundles:
  - **Tx/Diag**: antimalarial medicines + diagnostics
  - **Vector**: insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) + indoor residual spraying (IRS)
  - **Systems**: human resources, advocacy, monitoring, technical assistance
- Sorted countries into **incidence bins** (0.1–10, 10–50, 50–100, 100+ per 1,000 at risk).
- Defined **fast improvers** (top 25% of incidence reduction) vs **slow improvers** (bottom 25%).
- Compared their **bundle spending shares, absolute spending, and reallocation speed**.

Results:
- Low incidence: Fast improvers leaned more on Vector interventions, while slow improvers spent relatively more on Systems.  
- Medium incidence: Direct treatment & diagnostics (Tx/Diag) and faster reallocation away from Systems mattered most.  
- High incidence: Winners weren’t just “spending more on the right bundle” — success came from scale and speed. Fast improvers spent more overall (esp. on Tx/Diag) and shifted faster, while slow improvers often expanded Systems.  

These results illustrate that different malaria burden contexts require different policy mixes:  
Efficiency and reallocation at mid-level incidence, scale and speed at very high incidence, and targeted vector control at low incidence.
